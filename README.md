Word Game Application (Mad Libs) 
Purpose:  Word game application that is entertaining for people of all ages.  It also could be considered somewhat educational in that it demonstrates parts of speech, grammar, and punctuation.

Functionality:  The user will be prompted to enter various different parts of a sentence, such as verb, noun, and/or adjective, etc..  Each word entered will be stored in local storage.  Once all required information has been obtained, the words from local storage will populate a comical, entertaining phrase or story and present it back to the user to read.  After the user has completed reading the story, they can choose to play again, which will clear out the local storage and again prompt the user to enter verb, noun, adjective, etc.., or end the game.

Technologies:  HTML5, AngularJS, XML, JSON, API
Additional Functionality Consideration:   For the beginner English learner, instead of having to come up with a word on their own, there could be a list of words from an XML file to choose from to drag and drop to their respective grammar parts.  Also considering checking spelling as well as whether or not the user entered in the proper verb, noun, etc..
